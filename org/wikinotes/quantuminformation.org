* Fundamental Concepts
** Introduction and Overview
*** Computation
- No signal is faster than light \to No-cloning theorem
- Church-Turing thesis :: If an algorithm can be performed on /any/ piece of hardware, then there is an equivalent algorithm for an Universal Turing Machine.
- Strengthened version of Church-Turing thesis :: Any algorithmic process can be simulated efficiently using a Turing machine.

Analog computation appear to violate CT thesis. \to consider realistic noise.

/keyword/: quantum error-correcting codes, fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Whether an integer is prime or coposite can be tested using randomized algorithm. That is the *Solovay-Strassen test*.

- Modify strong Church-Turing thesis :: Any algorithmic process can be simulated efficiently using a probabilistic Turing machine.

1985 David Deutsch : quantum computer might have computational powers exceeding those of classical computers. 1994 Peter Shor, 1995 Lov Grover.

*** Communication
1948 Claude Shannon mathematically define the concept of information.
- Shannon's noiseless channel coding theorem :: quantifies the physical resources required to store the output from an information source.
- Shannon's noisy channel coding theorem :: how much information it is possible to reliably transmit through a noisy communications channel.

1995 Ben Schumacher provided an analogue to noiseless coding theorem, and defined qubit. However, no analogue to noisy channel coding theorem is yet known for quantum information.

1996, Robert Calderbank and Peter Shor, Andrew Steane discovered *CSS codes*.
1992, Charles Bennett and Stephen Wiesner explained how to transmit two classical bits using one qubit. *Superdense coding*

*Distributed quantum computation* quantum computers can require exponentially less communication to solve certain problems than would be required if the networked computers were classical.
*** Networked information theory
networked quantum information theory: While two reverse direction zero capacity channel has zero capacity in classical information theory, we can use it to send information using networked quantum information theory.

** Quantum bits
*Computational basis states*
\[
\left| \psi \right\rangle = \alpha \left| 0 \right\rangle + \beta \left| 1 \right\rangle
\]

**** Bloch sphere
\[
\left| \psi \right\rangle = \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \left| 0 \right\rangle + e^{i \phi} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \left| 1 \right\rangle
\]

**** *Bell state* or *EPR pair*
\[
\frac{\left| 00 \right\rangle + \left| 11 \right\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

** Quantum computation
*** Single qubit gates
There is only one single bit gate in classical bit.
- *Unitary* $U^{\dagger}U = I$ is the only constraint on quantum gates.
**** Quantum NOT gate acts /linarly/
\[
X \equiv \left[ 
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{array}
\right]
\]
\[
\alpha \left| 0 \right\rangle + \beta \left| 1 \right\rangle \Rightarrow \alpha \left| 1 \right\rangle + \beta \left| 0 \right\rangle
\]
**** $Z$ gate
\[
Z \equiv \left[ 
\begin{array}{cc}
1&0\\
0&-1
\end{array}
\right]
\]
**** /Hadamard/ gate
\[
H \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[ 
\begin{array}{cc}
1&1\\
1&-1
\end{array}
\right]
\]
*** Multiple qubit gates
- Any classical logic can be computed from the composition of NAND gates alone.
- Controlled-NOT gate
  1. Control qubit, target qubit
  2. The control qubit and the target qubit are XORed and stored in the target qubit
  3. \[
     U_{CN} = 
     \begin{array}{cccc}
     1&0&0&0\\
     0&1&0&0\\
     0&0&0&1\\
     0&0&1&0
     \end{array}
     \]
- Quantum gates are /reversible/.
- Any multiple qubit logic gate may be composed from CNOT and single qubit gates.
*** Quantum circuits
Requirement of quantum circuits:
- No loop (/acyclic/)
- No FANIN (not reversible)
- No FANOUT (no-cloning theorem)
Example:
**** Swaps the states of the two qubits.

**** The measure operation converts a single qubit state $\left| \psi \right\rangle \alpha \left| 0 \right\rangle + \beta \left| 1 \right\rangle$ into a probablistic classical bit M. (double-line means classical bit). Which is 0 with probability $\left| \alpha \right|^2$, or 1 with probability $\left| \beta \right|^2$.

**** A CNOT gate cannot copy a quantum state.$\left| \psi \right\rangle = \alpha \left| 0 \right\rangle + \beta \left| 1 \right\rangle$. Input $\left| \psi \right\rangle \left| 0 \right\rangle$ to a CNOT gate.
\[
\left[ \alpha \left| 0 \right\rangle + \beta \left| 1 \right\rangle\right] \left| 0 \right\rangle \Rightarrow \alpha \left| 00 \right\rangle+\beta \left| 11 \right\rangle
\]
however, 
\[
\left| \psi \right\rangle \left| \psi \right\rangle = \alpha^2 \left| 00 \right\rangle + \alpha \beta \left| 01 \right\rangle + \alpha \beta \left| 10 \right\rangle + \beta^2 \left| 11 \right\rangle
\]
