* Goals
A conceptual web of physics knowledge base on logical and/or historical order. Aim for easy understanding by human brain (use conceptual language). Can easily sort and search in multiple ways. For example, search all assumption and law that a assumption is base on, search all the theorems that a law or a assumption invoke.
** notes
- This is not a Wikipedia, page should be written so that one can catch the concept at the first glimpse. At least for people who have read the topic before.
* Feature
- A theorem per page.
- Every page are linked together with logical and/or historical relation.
- The web start from most basic observation, math theorem, intuition.
- Page are linked both forward and backward.
- Able to plot a relation graph (?).
- Several search method.
 
* Structure
** Page type
- *Fact*: experimental fact, sensory fact that intuition base on, math theorem.
- *Assumption*: may linked together.
- *Law*
- *Theorem*
- *Mathematical technique*: approximations and special techniques.
- *Specific cases*

* Implementation
- backward link should be done by computer.
